# Node.js Quiz Application

This is a simple Node.js-based quiz application that tests your knowledge of Node.js and React. The quiz includes a set of questions with multiple-choice options. The user has a limited amount of time to answer each question, and the application provides feedback based on the answers.

## Features:
- **Timed Quiz**: The quiz has a total time limit and a time limit for each individual question.
- **Friendly User Interface**: Clear instructions and feedback on answers, including correct/incorrect answers.
- **Countdown Timer**: The application warns the user when only 5 seconds are left to answer a question and displays the overall time remaining for the quiz.
- **Final Score**: The quiz concludes with a score and personalized feedback.
